            <h2>Directions</h2>

            <p>
            Victoria is easy to get to... as long as you like multi-modal transportation.  Situated on Vancouver Island
            (near Vancouver, which is not on the Island, confusingly enough), you will have to either fly or take a
            ferry of some sort to get here.  Though driving is the most convenient, Victoria has a decent transit system
            for getting around and it is easy to get to by bus (at least from Vancouver).

            <h3>Driving</h3>

            <dl>
               <dt>From Vancouver</dt>
               <dd>Take the 99 south towards Seattle. Just after the George Massey tunnel under the Fraser River, take
               the exit for Highway #17, signed for "ferries" and "Victoria via ferries". After about five or 10
               minutes, you'll hit the ferry terminal. Get into one of the lineups marked "Victoria".  The ferry takes
               about 1 hour and 35 minutes. After you get off the ferry, follow the directions to festival sites,
               above.</dd>

               <dt>From Seattle or further south</dt>
               <dd>Take the I5 north and go across the border, take Exit 28 for Highway #17, signed for "Tsawwassen" and
               "Ferries". After taking the exit, keep left and turn left at the traffic light onto Highway 17.  Once
               you're on Highway 17 heading for the ferries, follow directions as above from Vancouver. If you're really
               sneaky you can cut the corner and take Highway #10 from the 99 to Highway 17 in Tsawwassen - guaranteed
               to save you about 10 seconds, or get you lost in darkest Ladner if you aren't carrying an experienced
               navigator.<br>
               If you're feeling adventurous, try taking the ferry from Anacortes over to Sydney.  This will be far
               slower than the BC ferry from Tsawwasen.</dd>

            <h3>Border Information - for US travellers</h3>

            <p>
            The security situation at the border is ever-changing. If you are a juggler (which presumably you are,
            otherwise you wouldn't be reading this), be honest about all the equipment you are bringing and why you are
            bringing it; but do NOT say "I am a street performer" under any circumstances. If you are performing at the
            festival, tell them you won't be getting money for it.  Bring your passport or at the least photo ID, birth
            certificate, and proof of residency (a utility bill, etc).
            </p>

            <p>
            We have extensive experience going south to attend the Portland and Seattle festivals, but little experience
            going north: any US jugglers reading this who know more than we do, please email us and we'll update this
            page. 
            </p>

            <p>
            This page gives information for non-Canadians who will be performing at the show: according to this website
            you will not need a work permit:<br>
