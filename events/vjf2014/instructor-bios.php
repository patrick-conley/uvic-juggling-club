            <h2>Iain Culp</h2>
            <p>I have been practicing the flow arts for about 6 years. I picked up Poi in 2008, joined Spark! Circus on the Thai-Burmese border in 2010, met PsycuSix.Ψ and the Malay flow community in 2011, went to my first festivals in the U.S.A. and Korea in 2012, and taught classes for the first time at Philippine Flow Fest and Singapore's Bornfire Festival in 2013. I've moved back to the United States but am still eager to teach and share. Photos and Videos can be found linked at: facebook.com/light.en.ed
            <ul>
               <li>Man, that's long (string):A beginner to intermediate class about long-string levi-stick, ways to hold it, tech to be done with it, and tricks to make it easier to wrap and unwrap with the string. Because this is a long-string levi-stick class students should already have a wand (if short we will have extra string) and for space each student may need about a 3 meter radius.</li>
               <li>To Dance or not to dance: Movement with your prop: Standing complacently and still is boring. Jumping, spinning, and running around can be overwhelming. Help find a balance between these two states, add skill with your prop, and you've just come up with a winning act. This class focuses on body moment and filling the space while performing using awareness techniques adapted from Chinese KungFu and theatrical performance.</li>

            <h2>Matt Cantrell </h2>
            <p>Matt began trying to make a circle with a rope and jump through it about 1983 after reading a short article on rope spinning in Hoovey Burges’ Circus Techniques. He quickly learned that although roping was once a popular American hobby it was quickly becoming a lost art. He had to learn a lot by experimentation, trial and error. But he did get some help from a couple great ropers who he met at different times: Vince Bruce and Forrest Hobbs. There seems to be a revival of interest in roping recently and he's excited to be able to share some of what he knows at the Victoria Juggling festival!
            <ul>
               <li>Lasso Workshop:This workshop is for beginners or those that already can spin a rope and want to learn some more tricks. I will show what kind of rope to use, how to make your own lariats from bulk rope, how to take care of your ropes. Beginners will learn how to start a flat loop spinning and some basic tricks as well as some fundamental skills for learning more advanced tricks. Folks who have already spent time tying themselves up in knots will get some pointers on learning to step into/out of a loop, handshaking, juggles, butterfly, Texas skip, ocean wave.</li>
