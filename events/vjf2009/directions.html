<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The festival will take place in the Michele Pujol Room in the Student Union 

  Building (SUB) on the University of Victoria campus, in beautiful Victoria, BC.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Victoria is easy to get to... as long as you like multi-modal transportation. 

  Situated on Vancouver Island (near Vancouver, which is not on the Island, confusingly 

  enough), you will have to either fly or take a ferry of some sort to get here. 

  Though driving is the most convenient, Victoria has a decent transit system 

  for getting around and it is easy to get to by bus (at least from Vancouver).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For general information on all ferries to Victoria, see this page:<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Here is a map of UVic campus, which may prove very helpful in finding the SUB:

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1">From Downtown Victoria</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Just in case you live in Victoria and don't know how to get to the SUB at UVic, 

  here's how.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From downtown, Follow Fort Street up the hill out of town. Continue on as it 

  becomes a 2-way street; then turn left on Foul Bay Road. Stay on Foul Bay Rd 

  as it turns into Henderson Road (you may not even notice when this happens, 

  just stay on the same street, you can't go wrong) and gets you onto the UVic 

  campus - you'll pass the UVic sign on the right. Follow the road as it makes 

  a sharp right to turn into Ring Road. This road circles around campus and soon 

  you'll pass the SUB on your right. Keep going past the SUB (unless you're lucky 

  enough to get a parking spot right on Ring Road in from of the SUB), don't take 

  the turn to the right, pass the gym on your right and then turn right onto a 

  little side street. Past the gym, turn right to get into parking lot 2 or left 

  to get into 3. Follow the directions below to get from the parking lots back 

  to the SUB.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1">From Vancouver</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take the 99 south towards Seattle. Just after the George Massey tunnel under 

  the Fraser River, take the exit for Highway #17, signed for &quot;ferries&quot; 

  and &quot;Victoria via ferries&quot;. After about five or 10 minutes, you'll 

  hit the ferry terminal. Get into one of the lineups marked &quot;Victoria&quot;. 

  The ferry takes about 1 hour and 35 minutes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After you get off the ferry, follow the highway (still # 17) almost all the 

  way into town. Take the McKenzie Avenue turnoff (also signed for &quot;University 

  of Victoria&quot;) and turn left (East). Follow McKenzie, eventually you will 

  cross Gordon Head Road and see the sign on your right welcoming you to the UVic 

  campus. Stay in the left lane to proceed towards the SUB. After you pass the 

  stadium on your right the next two turns to the right will get you to parking 

  lots 2 and 3, either of these should have lots of space on weekends. In the 

parking lots, you will find yourself behind the gym and bookstore buildings. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Go towards the bus exchange, next to the bookstore, and you will see the SUB 

  across the road on the far side of the bus exchange. Go across the bus exchange 

  (use the crosswalks, those busses will run you down otherwise), across the road 

  at the crosswalk, and into the SUB. The Festival will be held in the Michel 

  Pujol Room at the far (south) end; it is the largest room in the building so 

  keep going down the hall until you see it.</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>From Seattle or Further South</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take the I5 north and go across the border, take Exit 28 for Highway # 

  17, signed for &quot;Tsawwassen&quot; and &quot;Ferries&quot;.   After taking the exit, keep left and
  turn left at the traffic light onto Highway 17.

  Once you're on Highway 17 heading for the ferries, follow directions as above 

  from Vancouver. If you're really sneaky you can cut the corner and take Highway 

  # 10 from the 99 to Highway 17 in Tsawwassen - guaranteed to save you about 

  10 seconds, or get you lost in darkest Ladner if you aren't carrying an experienced 

  navigator.<br>
  If you're feeling adventurous, try taking the ferry from Anacortes over to Sydney.  This will be far slower than the BC ferry from Tsawwasen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1">From Up-Island or the Sunshine Coast</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(If you're on the Sunshine Coast, first take the ferry to Comox, or head to 

  Vancouver and follow the above directions &quot;From Vancouver&quot;). Take 

  the Island Highway south. On the way into Victoria, turn left on McKenzie Avenue. 

  Stay on McKenzie underneath Highway # 17 (Pat Bay Highway) and follow the directions 

  given in &quot;From Vancouver&quot;, above, to get to campus.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1">From the Airport</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Follow Willingdon Rd to the stop sign at McTavish and turn left (following 

  everybody else). Immediately turn right onto Highway 17 and follow the directions 

  as in From Vancouver into town.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Laidlaw runs busses from the length and breadth of Vancouver Island, most of 

  the routes will get you to Victoria, some via Nanaimo. To take long-distance 

  busses to Victoria from the mainland, take the bus to Vancouver and from the 

  Vancouver main bus/train station take the PCL bus to Victoria; see directions &quot;From Vancouver&quot; below. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Take the PCL bus from the main bus/train station or any of its various pick-up 

  points in Vancouver to downtown Victoria (cost: $25 CDN including the ferry). 

  From downtown Victoria, the bus terminal is right across the street from a local 

  bus (BC Transit) stop. From that stop, take the # 4 UVic bus right to campus, 

  which puts you at the transit exchange across the road from the SUB. Follow 

  the directions to the SUB in &quot;Driving: From Vancouver&quot; if you can't 

  find the SUB from that point!</font></p>

<p><font size="+1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Using BC Transit Only (the Cheapest Possible Way, besides 

  hitching or biking)</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From Vancouver, take the # 601 to Ladner exchange. From there, take the # 640 

  to Tsawwassen ferry terminal. Walk on the ferry to Victoria. From the other 

  side, take the # 70 to downtown Victoria. From downtown Victoria, take either 

  the # 14 UVic or # 4 UVic bus (# 11 UVic via Uplands or # 7 works too, but is 

  slower) to UVic campus, which puts you at the transit exchange across the road 

  from the SUB. Follow the directions in &quot;Driving: From Vancouver&quot; if 

  you can't find the SUB from that point. Give yourself lots of time, if you time 

  the busses correctly this option will take about 3 1/2 to 4 hours from downtown 

  Vancouver to UVic.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+1">From Seattle</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You can take the Victoria Clipper foot passenger ferry service between Seattle 

  and Victoria. This will get you from downtown Seattle to downtown Victoria in 

  a couple of hours. From the terminal in downtown Victoria, turn left (East) 

  along Belleville Street until you get to Douglas street. There is a BC Transit 

  stop just to your left up Douglas street, across the road. Take the # 4 UVic 

  bus from this stop to get you to the UVic campus.<br>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><font size="+2">By Train</font></strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To get to Victoria by train, take Amtrak to Vancouver and then see directions &quot;Bus: From Vancouver&quot; above.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Via Rail runs a daily train from Courtenay on Vancouver Island to Victoria, 

  arriving at about 6pm each day. Then walk up Johnson Street to Douglas Street 

  and take either the # 14 or # 4 busses to campus. Check to make sure you are 

  getting on either bus in the right direction!<br>

  Border Information - for US travellers</strong></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The security situation at the border is ever-changing. If you are a juggler 
  (which presumably you are, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this), be honest 
  about all the equipment you are bringing and why you are bringing it; but do 
  NOT say &quot;I am a street performer&quot; under any circumstances. If you 
  are performing at the festival, tell them you won't be getting money for it. 
  Bring your passport or at the least photo ID, birth certificate, and proof of 
  residency (a utility bill, etc).</font></p>

We have extensive experience 
  going south to attend the Portland and Seattle festivals, but little experience
