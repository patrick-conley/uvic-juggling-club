            The <strong>9th "kind of annual" Victoria Juggling and Flow
            Festival</strong>, hosted by the UVic Juggling Club, is here, and
            will be as spectacular a showcase of juggling and object
            manipulation as in previous years.
            </p>

            <p>
            The festival will include two and a half days of workshops, from
            introductory to advanced levels; a renegade show, and a
            not-to-be-missed gala show. Workshops and open space are held at 
            UVic, in the McKinnon Gym; the gala show will be in the Esquimalt
            High School theatre.
            </p>

            <p>
            The festival takes place the 12th to 14th of February.
