            <p>
            The <strong>7th not-even-remotely-annual Victoria Juggling
               Festival</strong>, hosted by the UVic juggling club, is here, and
            will be as spectacular a showcase of juggling and object
            manipulation as in previous years.
            </p>

            <p>
            The festival will include two and a half days of workshops, from
            introductory to advanced levels; a renegade show, and a
            not-to-be-missed <a href="show.php">public show</a>. See the <a
               href="schedule.php">schedule</a> for details on event times,
            and the <a href="directions.php">directions</a> for locations.
            </p>

            <h3>Public show</h3>

            <p>
            The highlight of the festival will be a public gala show featuring
            performers from around British Columbia and the Pacific northwest,
            headlined by dance juggler Komei Aoki.

            <p>
            The show will be held in the evening of Saturday, January 19, at
            the Metro Theatre in downtown Victoria. <a
               href="show.php">See here</a> for more details,
            including directions and performers.
