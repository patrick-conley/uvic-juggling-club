               <li>Intro to Clown: By: Sharon Mahoney. Through this workshop, students will be participating in different games that will help develop instincts, increase energy and allow focus. With solo and partner work the workshop will concentrate on some clown basics: Optimism, enjoying failure, and finding the pleasure of play. A large part of workshop will allow students to find their own ridiculousness in a safe environment. We will work towards being free enough to find personal absurdity and the ability to use this as an advantage for the clown. Stupidity is welcome and applauded. &quot;I'm not funny, what I am is Brave&quot; Lucille Ball</li>
